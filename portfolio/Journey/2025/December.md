# December 2025 - A Month of Reflection

As we wrap up 2025, it's been an intense and rewarding month of building and planning. The year is coming to a close, but the momentum is building for what's ahead.

## Highlights

- **BowlRMS Development**: Made significant progress on the restaurant management system. The core features are solidifying, and we're preparing for the 2026 launch.
- **nijue.me Platform**: The journey timeline feature is now fully functional. Users can showcase their professional growth with interactive timelines.
- **Bidbee Auctions**: Beta testing phase going well.

## Reflections

This month taught me the importance of consistency and perseverance. Building products is a marathon, not a sprint. Each small victory compounds into larger achievements.

## Looking Forward

2026 is shaping up to be a pivotal year. All three projects are targeting their MVP launches. The groundwork laid this year will determine our success next year.
